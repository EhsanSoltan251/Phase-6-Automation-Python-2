# Phase-6-Automation-Python-2
Code for automating phase 6 and injection tuning.

Only the Automate_Phase_6.py code has been tested. The second method in the script is the one that works the best (by far) so please supply
the command line argument 2 when running the code.

at the top of the code, please replace shot_rate_pv with the PV that you want to tune based off (any of the PVs in the output dictionary) and it will automatically
adjust the values to use.
